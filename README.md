# hello-world
the simplest of the simplest

So I'm Kessius and I like to make music and - since a month or two - learn about coding and programming. I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little bit of C++ in the past, but now I'm really making an effort of learning python! 

A few projects I'm planning on doing:
- Making a digital synthesizer
- Making a digital tuner
- Making a pokerhand-value calculator 
- Making a videogame
- Making a webpage

I'm certain these things are not easy and some of them may not be best made in python, but I am actually not planning on sticking with python - although I want to understand it as good as possible. I want to try C++ again some time in the future and JavaScript. 

Salutations,

Kessius
